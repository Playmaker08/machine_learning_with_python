CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCING IMAGE PROCESSING AND SCIKIT-IMAGE

a) RGB to grayscale

In this exercise you will load an image from scikit-image module data and make it grayscale, then compare both of them in the output.

# Import the modules from skimage
from skimage import data, color

# Load the rocket image
rocket = data.rocket()

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_scaled_rocket = color.rgb2gray(rocket) 

# Show the original image
show_image(rocket, 'Original RGB image')

# Show the grayscale image
show_image(gray_scaled_rocket, 'Grayscale image')
