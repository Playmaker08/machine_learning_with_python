## CHAPTER 1: BASIC FEATURES AND READABILITY SCORES

a) One-hot encoding

# Print the features of df1
print(df1.columns)

# Perform one-hot encoding
df1 = pd.get_dummies(df1, columns=['feature 5'])

# Print the new features of df1
print(df1.columns)

# Print first five rows of df1
print(df1.head())
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    Index(['feature 1', 'feature 2', 'feature 3', 'feature 4', 'feature 5', 'label'], dtype='object')
    Index(['feature 1', 'feature 2', 'feature 3', 'feature 4', 'label', 'feature 5_female', 'feature 5_male'], dtype='object')
       feature 1  feature 2  feature 3  feature 4  label  feature 5_female  feature 5_male
    0     29.000          0          0    211.338      1                 1               0
    1      0.917          1          2    151.550      1                 0               1
    2      2.000          1          2    151.550      0                 1               0
    3     30.000          1          2    151.550      0                 0               1
    4     25.000          1          2    151.550      0                 1               0

b) Character count of Russian tweets

# Create a feature char_count
tweets['char_count'] = tweets['content'].apply(len)

# Print the average character count
print(tweets['char_count'].mean())
=> Notice that the average character count of these tweets is approximately 104, which is much higher than the overall average tweet length of around 40 characters. Depending on what you're working on, this may be something worth investigating into. For your information, there is research that indicates that fake news articles tend to have longer titles! Therefore, even extremely basic features such as character counts can prove to be very useful in certain applications.

c) Word count of TED talks

# Function that returns number of words in a string
def count_words(string):
	# Split the string into words
    words = string.split()
    
    # Return the number of words
    return len(words)

# Create a new feature word_count
ted['word_count'] = ted['transcript'].apply(count_words)

# Print the average word count of the talks
print(ted['word_count'].mean())
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    1987.1

d) Hashtags and mentions in Russian tweets

(i) # Function that returns number of hashtags in a string
def count_hashtags(string):
	# Split the string into words
    words = string.split()
    
    # Create a list of words that are hashtags
    hashtags = [word for word in words if word.startswith('#')]
    
    # Return number of hashtags
    return(len(hashtags))

# Create a feature hashtag_count and display distribution
tweets['hashtag_count'] = tweets['content'].apply(count_hashtags)
tweets['hashtag_count'].hist()
plt.title('Hashtag count distribution')
plt.show()

(ii) # Function that returns number of mentions in a string
def count_mentions(string):
	# Split the string into words
    words = string.split()
    
    # Create a list of words that are mentions
    mentions = [word for word in words if word.startswith('@')]
    
    # Return number of mentions
    return(len(mentions))

# Create a feature mention_count and display distribution
tweets['mention_count'] = tweets['content'].apply(count_mentions)
tweets['mention_count'].hist()
plt.title('Mention count distribution')
plt.show()

e) Readability of 'The Myth of Sisyphus'

# Import Readability
from readability import Readability

# Compute the readability scores object
readability_scores = Readability(sisyphus_essay)

# Print the flesch reading ease score
flesch = readability_scores.flesch()
print("The Flesch Reading Ease is %.2f" % (flesch.score))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    The Flesch Reading Ease is 68.65

f) Readability of various publications
In this exercise, you have been given excerpts of articles from four publications. Your task is to compute the readability of these excerpts using the Gunning fog score and consequently, determine the relative difficulty of reading these publications.

# Import Readability
from readability import Readability

# List of excerpts
excerpts = [forbes, harvard_law, r_digest, time_kids]

# Loop through excerpts and compute gunning fog index
gunning_fog_scores = []
for excerpt in excerpts:
  gf = Readability(excerpt).gunning_fog()
  gf_score = gf.score
  gunning_fog_scores.append(gf_score)

# Print the gunning fog indices
print(gunning_fog_scores)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    [16.333333333333332, 22.486808510638298, 12.164171779141105, 7.658560794044665]


## CHAPTER 2: TEXT PREPROCESSING, POS TAGGING, AND NER

a) Tokenizing the Gettysburg Address
import spacy

# Load the en_core_web_sm model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Create a Doc object
doc = nlp(gettysburg)

# Generate the tokens
tokens = [token.text for token in doc]
print(tokens)
=> Output: <script.py> output:

b) Lemmatizing the Gettysburg address

import spacy

# Load the en_core_web_sm model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Create a Doc object
doc = nlp(gettysburg)

# Generate lemmas
lemmas = [token.lemma_ for token in doc]

# Convert lemmas into a string
print(' '.join(lemmas))
=> Output: <script.py> output:

c) Cleaning a blog post
In this exercise, you have been given an excerpt from a blog post. Your task is to clean this text into a more machine friendly format. This will involve converting to lowercase, lemmatization and removing stopwords, punctuations and non-alphabetic characters.

Input: Twenty-first-century politics has witnessed an alarming rise of populism in the U.S. and Europe. The first warning signs came with the UK Brexit Referendum vote in 2016 swinging in the way of Leave. This was followed by a stupendous victory by billionaire Donald Trump to become the 45th President of the United States in November 2016. Since then, Europe has seen a steady rise in populist and far-right parties that have capitalized on Europe’s Immigration Crisis to raise nationalist and anti-Europe sentiments. Some instances include Alternative for Germany (AfD) winning 12.6% of all seats and entering the Bundestag, thus upsetting Germany’s political order for the first time since the Second World War, the success of the Five Star Movement in Italy and the surge in popularity of neo-nazism and neo-fascism in countries such as Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland and Austria.

# Load model and create Doc object
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc = nlp(blog)

# Generate lemmatized tokens
lemmas = [token.lemma_ for token in doc]

# Remove stopwords and non-alphabetic tokens
a_lemmas = [lemma for lemma in lemmas 
            if lemma.isalpha() and lemma not in stopwords]

# Print string after text cleaning
print(' '.join(a_lemmas))
=> Output: <script.py> output:

d) Cleaning TED talks in a dataframe
In this exercise, we will revisit the TED Talks from the first chapter. You have been a given a dataframe ted consisting of 5 TED Talks. Your task is to clean these talks using techniques discussed earlier by writing a function preprocess and applying it to the transcript feature of the dataframe.

# Function to preprocess text
def preprocess(text):
  	# Create Doc object
    doc = nlp(text, disable=['ner', 'parser'])
    # Generate lemmas
    lemmas = [token.lemma_ for token in doc]
    # Remove stopwords and non-alphabetic characters
    a_lemmas = [lemma for lemma in lemmas 
            if lemma.isalpha() and lemma not in stopwords]
    
    return ' '.join(a_lemmas)
  
# Apply preprocess to ted['transcript']
ted['transcript'] = ted['transcript'].apply(preprocess)
print(ted['transcript'])

e) POS tagging in Lord of the Flies
In this exercise, you will perform part-of-speech tagging on a famous passage from one of the most well-known novels of all time, Lord of the Flies, authored by William Golding.

Input: He found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life, where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of one’s waking life was spent watching one’s feet.

# Load the en_core_web_sm model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Create a Doc object
doc = nlp(lotf)

# Generate tokens and pos tags
pos = [(token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc]
print(pos)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    [('He', 'PRON'), ('found', 'VERB'), ('himself', 'PRON'), ('understanding', 'VERB'), ('the', 'DET'), ('wearisomeness', 'NOUN'), ('of', 'ADP'), ('this', 'DET'), ('life', 'NOUN'), (',', 'PUNCT'), ('where', 'ADV'), ('every', 'DET'), ('path', 'NOUN'), ('was', 'VERB'), ('an', 'DET'), ('improvisation', 'NOUN'), ('and', 'CCONJ'), ('a', 'DET'), ('considerable', 'ADJ'), ('part', 'NOUN'), ('of', 'ADP'), ('one', 'PRON'), ('’s', 'ADV'), ('waking', 'VERB'), ('life', 'NOUN'), ('was', 'AUX'), ('spent', 'VERB'), ('watching', 'VERB'), ('one', 'NUM'), ('’s', 'NOUN'), ('feet', 'NOUN'), ('.', 'PUNCT')]

f) Counting nouns in a piece of text

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

(i) # Returns number of proper nouns
def proper_nouns(text, model=nlp):
  	# Create doc object
    doc = model(text)
    # Generate list of POS tags
    pos = [token.pos_ for token in doc]
    
    # Return number of proper nouns
    return pos.count('PROPN')

print(proper_nouns("Abdul, Bill and Cathy went to the market to buy apples.", nlp))

(ii) # Returns number of other nouns
def nouns(text, model=nlp):
  	# Create doc object
    doc = model(text)
    # Generate list of POS tags
    pos = [token.pos_ for token in doc]
    
    # Return number of other nouns
    return pos.count('NOUN')

print(nouns("Abdul, Bill and Cathy went to the market to buy apples.", nlp))

g) Noun usage in fake news
In this exercise, you have been given a dataframe headlines that contains news headlines that are either fake or real. Your task is to generate two new features num_propn and num_noun that represent the number of proper nouns and other nouns contained in the title feature of headlines.Next, we will compute the mean number of proper nouns and other nouns used in fake and real news headlines and compare the values. If there is a remarkable difference, then there is a good chance that using the num_propn and num_noun features in fake news detectors will improve its performance.

(i)
headlines['num_propn'] = headlines['title'].apply(proper_nouns)

# Compute mean of proper nouns
real_propn = headlines[headlines['label'] == 'REAL']['num_propn'].mean()
fake_propn = headlines[headlines['label'] == 'FAKE']['num_propn'].mean()

# Print results
print("Mean no. of proper nouns in real and fake headlines are %.2f and %.2f respectively"%(real_propn, fake_propn))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    Mean no. of proper nouns in real and fake headlines are 2.40 and 4.67 respectively

(ii)
headlines['num_noun'] = headlines['title'].apply(nouns)

# Compute mean of other nouns
real_noun = headlines[headlines['label'] == 'REAL']['num_noun'].mean()
fake_noun = headlines[headlines['label'] == 'FAKE']['num_noun'].mean()

# Print results
print("Mean no. of other nouns in real and fake headlines are %.2f and %.2f respectively"%(real_noun, fake_noun))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    Mean no. of other nouns in real and fake headlines are 2.28 and 1.84 respectively

h) Named entities in a sentence

# Load the required model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Create a Doc instance 
text = 'Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google. Its headquarters is in Mountain View.'
doc = nlp(text)

# Print all named entities and their labels
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    Google ORG
    Mountain View GPE

i) Identifying people mentioned in a news article

Input: It’s' been a busy day for Facebook  exec op-eds. Earlier this morning, Sheryl Sandberg broke the site’s silence around the Christchurch massacre, and now Mark Zuckerberg is calling on governments and other bodies to increase regulation around the sorts of data Facebook traffics in. He’s hoping to get out in front of heavy-handed regulation and get a seat at the table shaping it.

def find_persons(text):
  # Create Doc object
  doc = nlp(text)
  
  # Identify the persons
  persons = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == 'PERSON']
  
  # Return persons
  return persons

print(find_persons(tc))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    ['Sheryl Sandberg', 'Mark Zuckerberg']


## CHAPTER 3: N-GRAM MODELS

a) Bag of Words model for movie taglines
In this exercise, you have been provided with a corpus of more than 7000 movie tag lines. Your job is to generate the bag of words representation bow_matrix for these taglines. For this exercise, we will ignore the text preprocessing step and generate bow_matrix directly.

# Import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Create CountVectorizer object
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Generate matrix of word vectors
bow_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Print the shape of bow_matrix
print(bow_matrix.shape)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    (7033, 6614)
Notice that the word vectors created have more than 6600 dimensions. However, most of these dimensions have a value of zero since most words do not occur in a particular tagline.

b) Analyzing dimensionality and preprocessing

# Import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Create CountVectorizer object
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Generate matrix of word vectors
bow_lem_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(lem_corpus)

# Print the shape of bow_lem_matrix
print(bow_lem_matrix.shape)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    (6959, 5223)
Notice how the number of features have reduced significantly from around 6600 to around 5223 for pre-processed movie taglines. The reduced number of dimensions on account of text preprocessing usually leads to better performance when conducting machine learning.

c) Mapping feature indices with feature names
Input: ['The lion is the king of the jungle', 'Lions have lifespans of a decade', 'The lion is an endangered species']

# Create CountVectorizer object
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Generate matrix of word vectors
bow_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Convert bow_matrix into a DataFrame
bow_df = pd.DataFrame(bow_matrix.toarray())

# Map the column names to vocabulary 
bow_df.columns = vectorizer.get_feature_names()

# Print bow_df
print(bow_df)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
       an  decade  endangered  have  is  ...  lion  lions  of  species  the
    0   0       0           0     0   1  ...     1      0   1        0    3
    1   0       1           0     1   0  ...     0      1   1        0    0
    2   1       0           1     0   1  ...     1      0   0        1    1
    
    [3 rows x 13 columns]

d) BoW vectors for movie reviews

# Import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Create a CountVectorizer object
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(lowercase=True, stop_words='english')

# Fit and transform X_train
X_train_bow = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform X_test
X_test_bow = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Print shape of X_train_bow and X_test_bow
print(X_train_bow.shape)
print(X_test_bow.shape)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    (250, 8158)
    (750, 8158)

e) Predicting the sentiment of a movie review
In the previous exercise, you generated the bag-of-words representations for the training and test movie review data. In this exercise, we will use this model to train a Naive Bayes classifier that can detect the sentiment of a movie review and compute its accuracy. Note that since this is a binary classification problem, the model is only capable of classifying a review as either positive (1) or negative (0). It is incapable of detecting neutral reviews.

# Create a MultinomialNB object
clf = MultinomialNB()

# Fit the classifier
clf.fit(X_train_bow, y_train)

# Measure the accuracy
accuracy = clf.score(X_test_bow, y_test)
print("The accuracy of the classifier on the test set is %.3f" % accuracy)

# Predict the sentiment of a negative review
review = "The movie was terrible. The music was underwhelming and the acting mediocre."
prediction = clf.predict(vectorizer.transform([review]))[0]
print("The sentiment predicted by the classifier is %i" % (prediction))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    The accuracy of the classifier on the test set is 0.732
    The sentiment predicted by the classifier is 0
Note that the accuracy of the classifier is 73.2%. Considering the fact that it was trained on only 750 reviews, this is reasonably good performance. The classifier also correctly predicts the sentiment of a mini negative review which we passed into it.

f) n-gram models for movie tag lines

# Generate n-grams upto n=1
vectorizer_ng1 = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,1))
ng1 = vectorizer_ng1.fit_transform(corpus)

# Generate n-grams upto n=2
vectorizer_ng2 = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2))
ng2 = vectorizer_ng2.fit_transform(corpus)

# Generate n-grams upto n=3
vectorizer_ng3 = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,3))
ng3 = vectorizer_ng3.fit_transform(corpus)

# Print the number of features for each model
print("ng1, ng2 and ng3 have %i, %i and %i features respectively" % (ng1.shape[1], ng2.shape[1], ng3.shape[1]))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    ng1, ng2 and ng3 have 6614, 37100 and 76881 features respectively

g) Higher order n-grams for sentiment analysis

# Define an instance of MultinomialNB 
clf_ng = MultinomialNB()

# Fit the classifier
clf_ng.fit(X_train_ng, y_train)

# Measure the accuracy
accuracy = clf_ng.score(X_test_ng, y_test)
print("The accuracy of the classifier on the test set is %.3f" % accuracy)

# Predict the sentiment of a negative review
review = "The movie was not good. The plot had several holes and the acting lacked panache."
prediction = clf_ng.predict(ng_vectorizer.transform([review]))[0]
print("The sentiment predicted by the classifier is %i" % (prediction))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    The accuracy of the classifier on the test set is 0.758
    The sentiment predicted by the classifier is 0

h) Comparing performance of n-gram models

start_time = time.time()
# Splitting the data into training and test sets
train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(df['review'], df['sentiment'], test_size=0.5, random_state=42, stratify=df['sentiment'])

# (1) Generating ngrams
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
train_X = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_X)
test_X = vectorizer.transform(test_X)

# (2) Generating ngrams
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,3))
train_X = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_X)
test_X = vectorizer.transform(test_X)

# Fit classifier
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Print accuracy, time and number of dimensions
print("The program took %.3f seconds to complete. The accuracy on the test set is %.2f. The ngram representation had %i features." % (time.time() - start_time, clf.score(test_X, test_y), train_X.shape[1]))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
   (1) The program took 0.153 seconds to complete. The accuracy on the test set is 0.75. The ngram representation had 12347 features.
   (2) The program took 0.958 seconds to complete. The accuracy on the test set is 0.77. The ngram representation had 178240 features.
The program took around 0.2 seconds in the case of the unigram model and more than 10 times longer for the higher order n-gram model. The unigram model had over 12,000 features whereas the n-gram model for upto n=3 had over 178,000! Despite taking higher computation time and generating more features, the classifier only performs marginally better in the latter case, producing an accuracy of 77% in comparison to the 75% for the unigram model.


## CHAPTER 4: TF-IDF AND SIMILARITY SCORES

a) tf-idf vectors for TED talks
In this exercise, you have been given a corpus ted which contains the transcripts of 500 TED Talks. Your task is to generate the tf-idf vectors for these talks.

# Import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Create TfidfVectorizer object
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Generate matrix of word vectors
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(ted)

# Print the shape of tfidf_matrix
print(tfidf_matrix.shape)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    (500, 29158)

b) Computing dot product
In this exercise, we will learn to compute the dot product between two vectors, A = (1, 3) and B = (-2, 2), using the numpy library. More specifically, we will use the np.dot() function to compute the dot product of two numpy arrays.

# Initialize numpy vectors
A = np.array([1,3])
B = np.array([-2, 2])

# Compute dot product
dot_prod = np.dot(A, B)

# Print dot product
print(dot_prod)
=> Output: <script.py> output: (The dot product of the two vectors is 1 * -2 + 3 * 2 = 4)
    4

c) Cosine similarity matrix of a corpus
Input: corpus:
 ['The sun is the largest celestial body in the solar system', 'The solar system consists of the sun and eight revolving planets', 'Ra was the Egyptian Sun God', 'The Pyramids were the pinnacle of Egyptian architecture', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog']

# Initialize an instance of tf-idf Vectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Generate the tf-idf vectors for the corpus
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Compute and print the cosine similarity matrix
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix,tfidf_matrix)
print(cosine_sim)
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    [[1.         0.36413198 0.18314713 0.18435251 0.16336438]
     [0.36413198 1.         0.15054075 0.21704584 0.11203887]
     [0.18314713 0.15054075 1.         0.21318602 0.07763512]
     [0.18435251 0.21704584 0.21318602 1.         0.12960089]
     [0.16336438 0.11203887 0.07763512 0.12960089 1.        ]]

d) Comparing linear_kernel and cosine_similarity

(i) Compute the cosine similarity matrix for tfidf_matrix using cosine_similarity.
# Record start time
start = time.time()

# Compute cosine similarity matrix
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)

# Print cosine similarity matrix
print(cosine_sim)

# Print time taken
print("Time taken: %s seconds" %(time.time() - start))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    [[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]
     [0.         1.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]
     [0.         0.         1.         ... 0.         0.01418221 0.        ]
     ...
     [0.         0.         0.         ... 1.         0.01589009 0.        ]
     [0.         0.         0.01418221 ... 0.01589009 1.         0.        ]
     [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         1.        ]]
    Time taken: 0.26941871643066406 seconds

(ii) Compute the cosine similarity matrix for tfidf_matrix using linear_kernel.
# Record start time
start = time.time()

# Compute cosine similarity matrix
cosine_sim = linear_kernel(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)

# Print cosine similarity matrix
print(cosine_sim)

# Print time taken
print("Time taken: %s seconds" %(time.time() - start))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    [[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]
     [0.         1.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]
     [0.         0.         1.         ... 0.         0.01418221 0.        ]
     ...
     [0.         0.         0.         ... 1.         0.01589009 0.        ]
     [0.         0.         0.01418221 ... 0.01589009 1.         0.        ]
     [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         1.        ]]
    Time taken: 0.2725694179534912 seconds
Notice how both linear_kernel and cosine_similarity produced the same result. However, linear_kernel took a smaller amount of time to execute. When you're working with a very large amount of data and your vectors are in the tf-idf representation, it is good practice to default to linear_kernel to improve performance. (NOTE: In case, you see linear_kernel taking more time, it's because the dataset we're dealing with is extremely small and Python's time module is incapable of capture such minute time differences accurately)

e) Plot recommendation engine
In this exercise, we will build a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on similarity of plot lines. You have been given a get_recommendations() function that takes in the title of a movie, a similarity matrix and an indices series as its arguments and outputs a list of most similar movies. indices has already been provided to you. You have also been given a movie_plots Series that contains the plot lines of several movies. Your task is to generate a cosine similarity matrix for the tf-idf vectors of these plots.

# Initialize the TfidfVectorizer 
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Construct the TF-IDF matrix
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(movie_plots)

# Generate the cosine similarity matrix
cosine_sim = linear_kernel(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
 
# Generate recommendations
print(get_recommendations('The Dark Knight Rises', cosine_sim, indices))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    1                              Batman Forever
    2                                      Batman
    3                              Batman Returns
    8                  Batman: Under the Red Hood
    9                            Batman: Year One
    10    Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1
    11    Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2
    5                Batman: Mask of the Phantasm
    7                               Batman Begins
    4                              Batman & Robin
    Name: title, dtype: object
 Notice how the recommender correctly identifies 'The Dark Knight Rises' as a Batman movie and recommends other Batman movies as a result. This sytem is, of course, very primitive and there are a host of ways in which it could be improved. One method would be to look at the cast, crew and genre in addition to the plot to generate recommendations.

f) The recommender function
In this exercise, we will build a recommender function get_recommendations(), as discussed in the lesson and the previous exercise. As we know, it takes in a title, a cosine similarity matrix, and a movie title and index mapping as arguments and outputs a list of 10 titles most similar to the original title (excluding the title itself).

# Generate mapping between titles and index
indices = pd.Series(metadata.index, index=metadata['title']).drop_duplicates()

def get_recommendations(title, cosine_sim, indices):
    # Get index of movie that matches title
    idx = indices[title]
    # Sort the movies based on the similarity scores
    sim_scores = list(enumerate(cosine_sim[idx]))
    sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    # Get the scores for 10 most similar movies
    sim_scores = sim_scores[1:11]
    # Get the movie indices
    movie_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]
    # Return the top 10 most similar movies
    return metadata['title'].iloc[movie_indices]

g) TED talk recommender

# Initialize the TfidfVectorizer 
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Construct the TF-IDF matrix
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(transcripts)

# Generate the cosine similarity matrix
cosine_sim = linear_kernel(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
 
# Generate recommendations
print(get_recommendations('5 ways to kill your dreams', cosine_sim, indices))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    453             Success is a continuous journey
    157                        Why we do what we do
    494                   How to find work you love
    149          My journey into movies that matter
    447                        One Laptop per Child
    230             How to get your ideas to spread
    497         Plug into your hard-wired happiness
    495    Why you will fail to have a great career
    179             Be suspicious of simple stories
    53                          To upgrade is human
    Name: title, dtype: object
This recommender works surprisingly well despite being trained only on a small subset of TED talks. In fact, three of the talks recommended by our system is also recommended by the official TED website as talks to watch next after '5 ways to kill your dreams'!

h) Generating word vectors
Input: I like apples and oranges

In this exercise, we will generate the pairwise similarity scores of all the words in a sentence. The sentence is available as sent and has been printed to the console for your convenience.

# Create the doc object
doc = nlp(sent)

# Compute pairwise similarity scores
for token1 in doc:
  for token2 in doc:
    print(token1.text, token2.text, token1.similarity(token2))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    I I 1.0
    I like 0.13463897
    I apples -0.036133606
    I and -0.085230574
    I oranges 0.033708632
    like I 0.13463897
    like like 1.0
    like apples 0.0007651703
    like and 0.104521796
    like oranges -0.045859136
    apples I -0.036133606
    apples like 0.0007651703
    apples apples 1.0
    apples and -0.051072996
    apples oranges 0.46452007
    and I -0.085230574
    and like 0.104521796
    and apples -0.051072996
    and and 1.0
    and oranges 0.038236685
    oranges I 0.033708632
    oranges like -0.045859136
    oranges apples 0.46452007
    oranges and 0.038236685
    oranges oranges 1.0

i) Computing similarity of Pink Floyd songs
# Create Doc objects
mother_doc = nlp(mother)
hopes_doc = nlp(hopes)
hey_doc = nlp(hey)

# Print similarity between mother and hopes
print(mother_doc.similarity(hopes_doc))

# Print similarity between mother and hey
print(mother_doc.similarity(hey_doc))
=> Output: <script.py> output:
    0.39086030814019257
    0.8043759483951038
Notice that 'Mother' and 'Hey You' have a similarity score of 0.9 whereas 'Mother' and 'High Hopes' has a score of only 0.6. This is probably because 'Mother' and 'Hey You' were both songs from the same album 'The Wall' and were penned by Roger Waters. On the other hand, 'High Hopes' was a part of the album 'Division Bell' with lyrics by David Gilmour and his wife, Penny Samson.
