## CHAPTER 1: INTRO TO PYTORCH

a) Getting started with PyTorch tensors
Tensors are PyTorch's core data structure and the foundation of deep learning. They're similar to NumPy arrays but have unique features. Here you have a Python list named temperatures containing daily readings from two weather stations. 

# Import PyTorch
import torch

temperatures = [[72, 75, 78], [70, 73, 76]]

# Create a tensor from temperatures
temp_tensor = torch.tensor(temperatures)

print(temp_tensor)
Output: <script.py> output:
    tensor([[72, 75, 78],
            [70, 73, 76]])
